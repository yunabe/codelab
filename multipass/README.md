# Multipass Instance Setup & SSH Configuration

This repository provides tools to simplify working with Multipass:

## Cloud-Init Configuration

Use the provided `cloud-config.cfg` file to launch a new Multipass instance with your desired settings (e.g., custom user, SSH keys, Golang installation).

**Usage:**

```bash
multipass launch 24.10 --name golang-dev --disk 20G --memory 4G --cloud-init golang-dev.cfg
```

## SSH Configuration Updater

An SSH updater script is included in this repository to automatically update your local `~/.ssh/config` with host entries for your running Multipass instances. This lets you SSH into instances by name without manual configuration.

```bash
./update_multipass_ssh.py
```
